	#Loading STAR via Great Lakes Bioinformatics

    #You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "star/2.7.6a-aekjdpr" module is available to load.

    #Installing / updating STAR - https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR - if for some reason you need to use a different version than the one that's installed on Great Lakes

		#You have two options for version. Running 

				module load Bioinformatics
				module load Bioinformatics  gcc/10.3.0-k2osx5y
				module load star/2.7.6a-aekjdpr
		
		#will call the STAR version installed on Great Lakes for general use. Or you can install a newer version and add it to your path.
		#Alternatively, you can get latest STAR source from releases
				wget https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/archive/2.7.10a.tar.gz #Check for latest version!
				tar -xzf 2.7.10a.tar.gz
				cd STAR-2.7.10a
				cd source
				make STAR
			#Add it to your path
				export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/STAR-2.7.10a/source
			#Or add it to your .bash_profile
				#Edit your bash profile to include the following line
				PATH=$PATH:[~your path to this~]/STAR-2.7.10a/source

	#Running the index
		#Write a Slurm script for the indexing job - see STAR_index.sh for an example
		#scale genomeSAindexNbases relative to genome size according to the formula min(14, log2([genome size]) / 2 - 1)
		#Put the Slurm script in a directory where you want to run it
		#Edit the permissions so that the user can execute the script
			chmod u+x STAR_index.sh
		#Run the script
			sbatch STAR_index.sh &
		#If it succeeds, you will end up with the following list of files

#Indexing a genome with RSubread

	#To index your genome with RSubread, you have three options
	
		# 1. Run the commands interactively from the RStudio Great Lakes GUI: go here and create an R session for yourself https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions. Use this script (RSubread_index_interactive.R) as a basis. In RStudio on Great Lakes, I requested 12GB of memory to successfully index the I. purpurea genome in 11.3 minutes
		
		#2. Run the commands interactively in the terminal on Great Lakes R. To call R in Great Lakes, run the following commands:
		
			module load R
			R
		
			#This will open a command-line R environment. Again, base your run on RSubread_index_interactive.R. 
		
		#3. You can submit an R job wrapped in a Slurm job (see SLURM_RSubread_index.sh, which calls RSubread_index_script.R). This is the most efficient way to do large and complex but requires a little extra setup.
