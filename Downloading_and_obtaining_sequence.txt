#Using the SRA toolkit to download sequence

    #Install SRA toolkit in your the directory of your choice: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-Installing-SRA-Toolkit
         
        wget --output-document sratoolkit.tar.gz https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
        tar -vxzf sratoolkit.tar.gz
        export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/sratoolkit.3.0.0-centos_linux64/bin
		which fastq-dump #If this doesn't work, check the path and your working directory
        #This should produce output similar to:
            /Users/JoeUser/sratoolkit.3.0.0-mac64/bin/fastq-dump
        #Configure: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/03.-Quick-Toolkit-Configuration
            #Store sequence either in /turbo for long-term storage or in /scratch for short-term storage
	
	#Identify the SRA project and samples you want to download
	#As an example, let's use some samples from Megan Van Etten's work: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA515629
	#Use the "Send to" button to download a csv describing what the files are - Send to > File > RunInfo
	#See more details here: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/08.-prefetch-and-fasterq-dump
	#Example for a single file:
		vdb-config --prefetch-to-cwd #Set the download destination directory to the working directory ("cwd" = "current working directory")
		prefetch SRR13449534 #This command prepares the download
		fasterq-dump SRR13449534 #Download the file (fasterq-dump is the high speed version of fastq-dump, which "dumps" a fastq file onto the local server)
		gzip SRR13449534.fastq & #Compress the fastq file so it takes up less space
	
	#For multiple files, use a slurm script like the example. Note that you can change the options for file location etc.
	#Download_from_SRA_array.sh is a slurm script to download SRA files from an id list like the example attached. To modify it for your own needs, you must 1) make your own id list and 2) change the line #SBATCH --array=1-89%10. The current format runs an array of 89 jobs, maximum 10 at a time. The top number should be the length of your list, the one after the "%" should be the number you want happening simultaneously. 
	
	#There are a variety of other approaches to batch downloading from the SRA. Explore what works for you. 

#Downloading a genome or annotation from COGE

    #Use a web browser to navigate to the genome of your choice - e.g., the Ipomoea purpurea genome https://genomevolution.org/coge/GenomeInfo.pl?gid=58735
    #Transfer the files using Filezilla
	#COGE may add a string to the beginning of genome fasta headings. Eric Lyons believes this was done "to make blastdb happy when dealing with string vs number names for chromosomes" and provides a perl script to fix it:
	cp Ipomoea_purpurea.faa Ipomoea_purpurea_headings_fixed.faa
	perl -i -p -e "s/^lcl\|//g" Ipomoea_purpurea_headings_fixed.faa &
	#STAR requires a gtf. If you downloaded a gffs, consider converting with gffread https://github.com/gpertea/gffread
		export PATH=$PATH:/home/jlrifkin/Software/gffread
		gffread -T Ipomoea_purpurea_annos1-cds0-id_typename-nu1-upa1-add_chr0.gid58735.gff -o Ipomoea_purpurea_annos1-cds0-id_typename-nu1-upa1-add_chr0.gid58735.gtf &
