#General Great Lakes tip - to find software, run "module spider <pkg_name>" and see if Great Lakes has a copy already installed


#I have also provided some modules in the Baucom lab long-term storage: /nfs/turbo/rsbaucom/lab/Lmod
#To use them, first type: 
#		module use /nfs/turbo/rsbaucom/lab/Lmod 
#then 
#		module load [module_name]

#Finally, you can always install your own copy of software and add it to your path

#0. Identify your goals. Do you want to ...
    quantify expression levels?
    call SNPs?
    identify GO groups / gene functions?
    categorize mutations into synonymous vs. nonsynomymous? 
    perform tests of selection? (e.g. dn/ds)

#1. Download / obtain sequence
    Where will you store your sequence? Is this short-term or long-term storage?
    Note that most sequencing facilities will give you a portal or wget script to download new reads. 
	Detailed instructions: 
		Downloading_and_obtaining_sequence.txt 
    Sample script:
		Download_from_SRA_array.sh will download a list of files from the SRA. 

#2. QC reads (after 1)
	Use FastQC to get a file-by-file picture of what's up with your reads
	Use MultiQC to summarize FastQC results for many files
	Consider the specific QC expectations for your sequencing type. What are your expectations about levels of sequence duplication, read length, and quality depending on whether you are using short- or long-read sequencing of a whole-genome library, a transcriptome library, a reduced representation library, etc.?
	Detailed instructions: 
		QC.txt
    Sample script: 
		FastQC_array.sh
		

#3. Trim reads (after 1 and 2)
    Deciding whether to trim: trimming off adapters is an extra computational step that adds time. It's probably better for some downstream analyses, but reads clipped by trimming software can often be rescued and some downstream software (e.g. Subreads, GATK, STAR) handles untrimmed reads fine, particularly with RNASeq. Trimming reduces available information, as well as increasing computational demands. Trim if you want to prioritize quality for some applications (e.g. assembly), or skip trimming if you're in a hurry, really want to squeeze every drop out of the sequence data, or are using a pipeline that doesn't require it. Best practices and research findings on this seem to change frequently, so it's a good place to weigh the options and make a judgment call. 
	There are many options; here are example scripts for two of them
    Trimmomatic - powerful, tuneable trimming software for adapter removal and quality trimming
	Trim galore - easy to use wrapper for FastQC and Cutadapt, which automatically removes Illumina adapters
	Detailed instructions: 
		Trimming.txt
    Sample script: 
		Trim_Galore_array.sh
		Trimmomatic_array.sh


#4. Prepare your resources: find your genome, find your annotation (if using), choose your aligner, update your alignment software, and index your genome (before or after 1)
    Remember, a DNA aligner isn't an RNA aligner!
    For short reads: STAR or RSubreads https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/8/e47/5345150 | https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz114
    For long reads: GMAP (unlikely to come up) https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/5/748/4562330
	Detailed instructions: 
		Downloading_and_obtaining_sequence.txt
		Index_genome.txt
    Sample scripts: 
		STAR_index.sh
		RSubread_index_script.R
		SLURM_RSubread_index.sh
		RSubread_index_script_interactive.R
		
		
#5. Align your reads!
	
	STAR 2-pass (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) is recommended in the Broad Institute's GATK best practices. It is fast and sensitive. The 2-pass structure is tricky, but improves detection of splice junctions. The scripts here draw on this pipeline: https://evodify.com/rna-seq-star-snakemake/

	RSubread is a fast and powerful aligning and read-counting pipeline embedded in R. It can be run either interactively or https://www.biostars.org/p/334107/

	Detailed instructions: 
		Alignment.txt
    Sample scripts: 
		Star_pass_1_array.sh
		Star_pass_2_array.sh
		RSubread_align_interactive.R #Align small numbers of files interactively in RStudio or R running on Great Lakes
		SLURM_RSubread_align.sh #Wrapper for submitting RSubread_align_script.R as a job
		RSubread_align_script.R #Align large numbers of files unattended

#6. Analyze! Select relevant steps below.


#7. Quantify expression levels

    Count reads - edgeR, STAR-featureCounts, cuffdiff2

    Compare read counts - edgeR, deSEQ2 
	
	Visualize data using VIDGER
    
#8. Call SNPs

	#Filter SNPs
