Outline

#0. Identify your goals. Do you want to ...
    quantify expression levels?
    call SNPs?
    identify GO groups / gene functions?
    categorize mutations into synonymous vs. nonsynomymous? 
    perform tests of selection? (e.g. dn/ds)

#1. Download / obtain sequence
    Where will you store your sequence? Is this short-term or long-term storage?
    Note that most sequencing facilities will give you a portal or wget script to download new reads. 
    Sample: SRA download to scratch

#2. QC reads (after 1)
	Use FastQC to get a file-by-file picture of what's up with your reads
	Use MultiQC to summarize FastQC results for many files

#3. Trim reads (after 1 and 2)
    Deciding whether to trim: trimming off adapters is an extra computational step that adds time. It's probably better for downstream analyses but can be skipped if you want to.

#4. Prepare your resources: find your genome, find your annotation (if using), choose your aligner, update your alignment software, and index your genome (before or after 1)
    Remember, a DNA aligner isn't an RNA aligner!
    For short reads: STAR or RSubreads https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/8/e47/5345150 | https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz114
    For long reads: GMAP (unlikely to come up) https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/5/748/4562330

#5. Align your reads!


#6. Analyze! Select relevant steps below.


#7. Quantify expression levels

    Count reads - edgeR in rsubreads

    Compare read counts - deSEQ in rsubreads
    
#8. Call SNPs
