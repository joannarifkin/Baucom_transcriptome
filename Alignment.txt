#Aligning with STAR 2-pass

#STAR 2-pass first aligns all samples to collect a database of splice junctions, then repeats the alignment with the complete list of splice junctions as priors. There are two SLURM demo scripts here
#Star_pass_1_array.sh collects a list of .fastq.gz files (the expression as written calls 5 files)
#You have two options for version. Adding 

		module load Bioinformatics
		module load Bioinformatics  gcc/10.3.0-k2osx5y
		module load star/2.7.6a-aekjdpr
will call the STAR version installed on Great Lakes for general use. Or you can install a newer version and add it to your path.
