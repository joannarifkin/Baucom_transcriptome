#Download FastQC from this website: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html#fastqc
#Transfer the zip file into your software directory on Great Lakes and unzip it ("unzip fastqc[version].zip")
#INSTALL.txt contains instructions to run FastQC

#Add FastQC to your path, either permanently via your .bash_profile or using this command: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/FastQC

#You can run FastQC interactively if you just want to look at one file at a time:

Make sure x11 forwarding is enabled AND xming is running https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34932495/forward-x11-failed-network-error-connection-refused/44575703

zcat your_file.fastq.gz | fastqc stdin -o FastQC &

#To run FastQC on all the files in the directory, run the script FastQC_array.sh using sbatch. 


#Summarize FastQC results with MultiQC

#Rather than looking at each FastQC result individually, summarize them with MultiQC

#First, install the package https://multiqc.info/docs/#installing-multiqc
#I have installed with pip and upgraded a couple of packages with dependencies
python3 -m pip install --user multiQC
python3 -m pip install --user numpy --upgrade
python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib --upgrade

#To run MultiQC on all the files in a directory of sequence, simply enter:
 multiqc [directory] &
 multiqc . & #Run on current directory
 multiqc /results/ #Run on directory via path
#MultiQC will generate an .html file. The easiest way to see this is to transfer it to your computer
