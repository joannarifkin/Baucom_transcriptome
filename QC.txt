#Performing sequence QC 

#Download FastQC from this website: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html#fastqc
#Transfer the zip file into your software directory on Great Lakes and unzip it ("unzip fastqc[version].zip")
#INSTALL.txt contains instructions to run FastQC

#Add FastQC to your path, either permanently via your .bash_profile or using this command: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/FastQC

#You can run FastQC interactively if you just want to look at one file at a time:

Make sure x11 forwarding is enabled AND xming is running https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34932495/forward-x11-failed-network-error-connection-refused/44575703

zcat your_file.fastq.gz | fastqc stdin -o FastQC &

#To run FastQC on all the files in the directory, run the script FastQC_array.sh using sbatch. 


#Summarize FastQC results with MultiQC

#Rather than looking at each FastQC result individually, summarize them with MultiQC

#First, install the package https://multiqc.info/docs/#installing-multiqc
#I have installed with pip and upgraded a couple of packages with dependencies
python3 -m pip install --user multiQC
python3 -m pip install --user numpy --upgrade
python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib --upgrade

#To run MultiQC on all the files in a directory of sequence, simply enter:
 multiqc [directory] &
 multiqc . & #Run on current directory
 multiqc /results/ #Run on directory via path
#MultiQC will generate an .html file. The easiest way to see this is to transfer it to your computer

In transcriptome sequence, we expect to see high levels of sequence duplication.
